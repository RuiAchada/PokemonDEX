# PokemonDEX

PokemonDEX is a react application to view pokemon details with a battle mode as well.

## Installation

npm install
```

## Run the project

```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll find the app running on localhost:3001

## Notes:

To choose a pokemon into the pokeballs, click on a pokemon to see its details and click the button "Choose"

For the battle, it's mandatory to choose 10 pokemon (5 player, 5 CPU)

You cannot choose the same pokemon for the same team

The game is really easy if you use always the bottom attacks (special attacks)
